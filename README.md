# Adjustable Fixture Mechanism

## Overview
This project involves the design and fabrication of an **adjustable fixture mechanism** for precise positioning of two sensors:
- **Pyrometer sensor**
- **LLT 30X0-25 BL sensor**

The fixture is used in a **surface grinding machine** to enable both sensors to take accurate readings from the grinding wheel. Despite the limited space available, the fixture is designed to align the lasers from both sensors to a **single measurement point**.

## Key Features
### 1. **Compact and Durable Design**
- Constructed using **stainless steel (SS)** to ensure strength and resistance to wear.
- Optimized to accommodate both sensors in a small space without compromising functionality.

### 2. **Adjustable Movements**
- **Scan Control Sensor:**
  - Slots for **left and right movement**.
  - **Rotational adjustment** for fine alignment.
- **Pyrometer Sensor:**
  - **Inclined sliding movement** for precise targeting of the grinding wheel.

### 3. **Enhanced Precision**
- Allows the sensors to align their lasers at a **single focal point**, ensuring accurate and consistent data collection.

## Applications
- **Surface Grinding Machines**:  
  Designed for real-time monitoring and precise measurements from the grinding wheel.
  
- **Industrial Measurements**:  
  Ideal for scenarios requiring compact setups and high-precision sensor alignment.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Mount the Fixture**:  
   Attach the fixture to the designated area on the surface grinding machine.

2. **Align the Sensors**:  
   Use the provided adjustment slots:
   - For the **scan control sensor**, adjust left/right and rotational slots.
   - For the **pyrometer sensor**, use the inclined sliding mechanism.

3. **Secure the Positions**:  
   Once aligned, securely tighten all adjustments.

4. **Start the Machine**:  
   Begin operations with the sensors taking precise readings from the grinding wheel.
